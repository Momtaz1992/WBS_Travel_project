# Primer Travel Blog
This is a simple travel blog website built using HTML and CSS. The website is designed to showcase travel destinations and experiences, 
and includes several sections such as a Home page, About Us page, Destinations page, and Contact Us page.

The website uses a responsive and mobile-friendly design, with a clean and modern layout that focuses on the visual elements of the travel destinations. 
The color scheme is inspired by nature, with shades of green and blue that evoke a sense of relaxation and adventure.

The website includes several features, such as a navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate between pages, 
a hero section on the Home page that showcases a featured destination, and a footer section that includes links to social media accounts.

The code for this project is a great exercise for learning HTML and CSS, as it requires implementing a responsive layout, 
using CSS to style elements, and using HTML to structure the content. It can also be expanded upon by adding additional pages, 
features, and functionalities.

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it easy to share with others and showcase your skills as a web developer.
